            <li>
                <h4>Instantiate</h4>

                <p>In the beginning stage of chain of development, we work with you and your team to know the actual
                    existence of concepts and abstraction of your objectives and goals. There is lot of communication
                    between us and your team at this stage. Lets rare a share to bring those imaginations into the first

                <h4>Design</h4>

                <p>With the knowledge acquired through the instantiate stage we start the theoretical reviews and
                    construct a plan with concept. At the end of this stage we will be having a clear picture on

                <h4>Foster</h4>

                <p>This is where the attempt starts to build product in real. Your project goes from design phase till
                    actually working module. In this stage all the plans and concepts from the earlier stage will turn
                    into prototype.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Launch</h4>

                <p>The prototype from foster goes into different stages of testing. Once we are very sure about the
                    product is running very smooth with a error free environment, the product is set to launch. It is
                    the feeling of lively and cheerful joy, as the great effort to endure comes to the condition of
